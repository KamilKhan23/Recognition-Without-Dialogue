# Recognition-Without-Dialogue
Recognition Without Dialogue is an exploratory interactive system that investigates how recognition, familiarity, and trust can emerge through non-verbal interaction rather than dialogue, objectives, or explicit instruction.  The project presents a minimal encounter between a player and an abstract figure within a sparse environment. The system responds to player proximity and stillness with a delayed acknowledgment, emphasizing patience and presence over action or efficiency. Through repeated encounters, the acknowledgment delay decreases, modeling familiarity rather than scripted progression. This learning persists across play sessions, reinforcing the sense of an ongoing relationship rather than a reset simulation.  Environmental elements subtly reflect this evolving interaction. Ambient lighting gradually shifts in warmth and intensity, and a low atmospheric sound fades in as recognition deepens. These changes are intentionally understated, functioning as affective cues rather than explicit feedback. At a final stage of familiarity, the figure ceases to track the player entirely, suggesting that sustained trust removes the need for surveillance.  By avoiding dialogue, scoring, or narrative exposition, the project foregrounds interpretation and embodied experience. Meaning emerges from how the player chooses to approach, wait, leave, or return. The system does not reward or punish behavior; instead, it invites reflection on how computational systems can express relational concepts through time, memory, and environmental response.  This project was developed as a portfolio piece for graduate study in Computational Media, with a focus on expressive systems, interpretive interaction, and performative minimalism.
