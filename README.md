# Recognition-Without-Dialogue
Recognition Without Dialogue is an exploratory interactive system that investigates how recognition, familiarity, and trust can emerge through non-verbal interaction rather than dialogue, objectives, or explicit instruction.  The project presents a minimal encounter between a player and an abstract figure within a sparse environment. The system responds to player proximity and stillness with a delayed acknowledgment, emphasizing patience and presence over action or efficiency. Through repeated encounters, the acknowledgment delay decreases, modeling familiarity rather than scripted progression. This learning persists across play sessions, reinforcing the sense of an ongoing relationship rather than a reset simulation.  Environmental elements subtly reflect this evolving interaction. Ambient lighting gradually shifts in warmth and intensity, and a low atmospheric sound fades in as recognition deepens. These changes are intentionally understated, functioning as affective cues rather than explicit feedback. At a final stage of familiarity, the figure ceases to track the player entirely, suggesting that sustained trust removes the need for surveillance.  By avoiding dialogue, scoring, or narrative exposition, the project foregrounds interpretation and embodied experience. Meaning emerges from how the player chooses to approach, wait, leave, or return. The system does not reward or punish behavior; instead, it invites reflection on how computational systems can express relational concepts through time, memory, and environmental response.  This project was developed as a portfolio piece for graduate study in Computational Media, with a focus on expressive systems, interpretive interaction, and performative minimalism.
# Recognition Without Dialogue

An exploratory interactive system investigating how recognition and trust can emerge through non-verbal interaction, persistent memory, and environmental response rather than dialogue or explicit objectives.

## Overview

This project presents a minimal interactive encounter between a player and an abstract figure within a sparse environment. The system intentionally avoids language, scoring, or narrative exposition, foregrounding interpretation and embodied experience instead.

Recognition is not immediate. The figure responds only after the player remains within proximity for a sustained period of time, emphasizing stillness and patience rather than action or efficiency. Through repeated encounters, the delay before acknowledgment decreases, modeling familiarity rather than scripted progression. This learning persists across play sessions, reinforcing the sense of an ongoing relationship rather than a reset simulation.

Environmental elements subtly reflect this evolving interaction. Ambient lighting gradually becomes warmer and more present, and a low atmospheric sound fades in as recognition deepens. These changes are intentionally understated, functioning as affective cues rather than explicit feedback. At a final stage of familiarity, the figure ceases to track the player entirely, suggesting that sustained trust removes the need for surveillance.

## Key Concepts

- Non-verbal interaction
- Recognition through proximity and time
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Environmental storytelling via light and sound
- Interpretive, player-driven meaning

The video demonstrates first encounters, repeated interactions, persistent memory across sessions, and the final stabilized state of the system.

## Technical Implementation

The system is implemented in Unity using C#. Core behaviors include:

- Proximity-based presence detection
- Time-delayed acknowledgment
- Persistent learning using saved state
- Gaze behavior with eventual disengagement
- Environmental response mapped to recognition state
